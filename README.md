# Welcome to my CS 5001 Project: Data Analysis of COVID-19

## Project Design:

Premise:
1. Ever since the start of pandemic, numbers and numbers everywhere. Want to know what they really mean? How are they calculated?
2. NEWS: All they ever do is spread fear: always reporting # of cases, deaths but no mention of recovery
    - **Number of cases is not the biggest concern, overwhelming health care facilities is the biggest concern**

Three Stage Project:
- **For presentation in CS5001 for December 14 and 16, will be working on Part 1**

1. Recreating British Columbia COVID-19 model and analyzing any correlation with confounding factors such as:
    - demographics (age, gender, residence)
    - income
    - hospitalization rate

- *WANT TO EVENTUALLY CREATE A PREDICTIVE MODEL*

- If successful, plan to move to Part 2 and Part 3 *(Potential master's thesis?)*

2. Adding more confounding factors and performing a comparative study with different provinces in Canada
3. Performing a comparative study for COVID-19 response between developed and emerging nations (Maybe the top 10 nations in terms of numbers)

Main purpose of project:
1. Self development. Learn more about python and it's different libraries
2. Play with real datasets and perfrom analysis of data

Targeted audience for project:
1. Geared towards public health agencies managing pandemic response
    - what have we learned from the pandemic
    - preventing pandemics in the future

Process:
1. Data Analysis:
   - read multiple datasets, clean, merge them using Jupyter notebooks. Great that can use it in VSCode.
   - visualizations: charts, makes it easy to understand the data
   - learned so far: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplot lib
   - *still need to learn how to use fastai*

2. Presenting the output:
   - want to present the output in the form of a website made using bootstrap, flask libraries
   - HTML, CSS and Javascript (basic) will be used
   - want to add API with live COVID-19 data around the globe
   - website deployed on the web through heroku (similar AWS)
   - *also want to upload a merged CSV file of all my cleaned data for future use*

Source of dataset collection:
1. John Hopkins World COVID-19 dataset
2. BC COVID-19 dataset (Last updated on November 23, 2020)
3. COVID-19 healthdata.org

Latest Problems (November 29, 2020):
- How do I add my charts and plots from Jupyter notebooks to my website?
- what do need to do to make a predictive model, right now have a static data, eventually want something like a pivot table that a user can play with
- since using pandas, a lot of previously written functions are not needed anymore, use different ways to use functions
- want to have an output file, filter data
