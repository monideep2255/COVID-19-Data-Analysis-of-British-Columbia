# Welcome to my CS 5001 Project: Data Analysis of COVID-19

## Project Design:

Premise:
1. Ever since the start of pandemic, numbers and numbers everywhere. Want to know what they really mean? How are they calculated?
2. NEWS: All they ever do is spread fear: always reporting # of cases, deaths but no mention of recovery
- Number of cases is not the biggest concern, overwhelming health care facilities is the biggest concern
